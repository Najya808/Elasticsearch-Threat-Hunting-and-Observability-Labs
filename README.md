# Elasticsearch-Threat-Hunting-and-Observability-Labs
Hands-on lab exercises from the Alrazzaq internship focusing on Elasticsearch deployment, Elastic Security (SIEM), Kibana dashboards, log ingestion, threat detection, and observability using logs, metrics, and APM, aligned with CIS security best practices.

- (Lab_01_Installing_Elasticsearch.md)  
  Learn to download, install, and configure Elasticsearch, verify the service, and understand basic cluster and network settings. This foundational lab prepares you for all subsequent Elasticsearch exercises in threat hunting and observability.

- (Lab_02_Installing_Kibana.md)  
  Installed and configured Kibana to connect with an Elasticsearch instance, verifying successful integration for centralized log visualization and analysis.

- (Lab_03_Basic_Elasticsearch_Querying.md)  
  Performed fundamental Elasticsearch queries including listing indices, retrieving documents, and refining results using query parameters for effective data exploration.

- (Lab_04_Loading_Sample_Log_Data.md)  
  Created structured sample logs and ingested them into Elasticsearch using Kibana upload and ingest pipelines, validating data parsing in Discover.

- (Lab_05_Understanding_Indices_Shards_Replicas.md)  
  Created and explored custom indices in Elasticsearch with different shard and replica settings, analyzing their impact on performance and fault tolerance.

- (Lab_06_Basic_Kibana_Discover_Usage.md)  
  Learned how to navigate Kibana Discover: selecting indices, applying filters, adjusting time ranges, sorting data, and saving custom search views for future use.
