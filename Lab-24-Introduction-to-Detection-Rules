# Lab 24 – Introduction to Detection Rules

##  Objective

- Understand detection rules in Elastic Security
- Activate prebuilt detection rules
- Generate test events
- Verify alert triggering

---

##  Tools Used

- Elastic Security
- Kibana
- Linux CLI

---

##  Environment Setup

Accessed Elastic Security via Kibana:

Security → Detections → Rules

---

##  Task 1: Explore Prebuilt Detection Rules

- Navigated to Security → Detections → Rules
- Reviewed available prebuilt rules
- Selected: Suspicious Process Execution

Key Concepts:
- Detection Rules
- Alert Triggering
- SOC Monitoring

---

## Task 2: Activate Detection Rule

Enabled rule:

{
  "rule_id": "suspicious-process-execution",
  "enabled": true
}

Confirmed rule status changed to Active.

---

##  Task 3: Generate Test Event

Simulated suspicious process:

```bash
echo "Simulating suspicious process execution" > /tmp/suspicious.sh
chmod +x /tmp/suspicious.sh
/tmp/suspicious.sh
🚨 Alert Verification

Navigated to:

Security → Detections → Alerts

Verified that alert was triggered successfully.

 Skills Gained

Alert validation

Threat simulation

SOC workflow understanding

 Conclusion

Successfully activated and tested a prebuilt detection rule in Elastic Security.
Validated alert generation by simulating suspicious activity.
