# Lab — Basic License vs. Platinum Features (Awareness)

## Objectives
- Understand the differences between Basic and Platinum features of open-source tools.
- Identify which features are available under the Basic (free) license.
- Discuss licensing and deployment considerations.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a computer with internet connectivity.
- Basic understanding of open-source tools and licensing.
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces.

## Lab Outline

### 1. Introduction to Licensing Models
Open-source tools often have multiple licensing models:

- **Basic (Free) License**: Provides essential features with some limitations.
- **Platinum License**: Includes advanced features and premium support.

### 2. Comparing Features

#### 2.1 Machine Learning (ML) Capabilities
- **Basic License**: Limited ML functionalities (predefined models or basic training).
- **Platinum Features**: Advanced ML tools, custom model development, and extensive training abilities.

#### 2.2 Alerting Systems
- **Basic License**: Simple alert functionalities (email alerts, threshold-based notifications).
- **Platinum Features**: Advanced alerting including SMS notifications, scenario-based alerts, and integrations with other systems.

#### 2.3 Security Features
- **Basic License**: Fundamental security (basic encryption, access controls).
- **Platinum Features**: Enhanced security (threat detection, advanced encryption, active monitoring).

#### 2.4 SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- **Basic License**: May not support SAML; limited integration with SSO.
- **Platinum Features**: Full SAML support for enterprise-level Single Sign-On integration.

#### 2.5 Canvas for Visualization
- **Basic License**: Basic visualization capabilities using pre-built templates.
- **Platinum Features**: Customizable dashboards, advanced graphics, and in-depth data analyses.

### 3. Task: Verify Available Features Under Basic License

#### 3.1 Checking Installed Features
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Example command for checking features in a hypothetical open-source tool
toolname --list-features

Output Interpretation: Indicates which features are active under your current license.

3.2 Comparison Exercise

Create a table comparing Basic vs Platinum features.

Highlight features that can be leveraged without a Platinum subscription.

4. Licensing and Deployment Considerations
4.1 Licensing Implications

Evaluate organizational needs and determine if the Basic License is sufficient.

Consider scalability, feature access, and support needs.

Understand cost implications for upgrading to Platinum.

4.2 Deployment Strategies

Deploy modular elements on-premise if security or customization requirements exist.

Use Basic License for testing/development environments to minimize costs.

Conclusion

Learned the core differences between Basic and Platinum features.

Verified available features under the Basic license.

Understood the importance of informed licensing decisions based on organizational needs.

Recommended consulting IT or tool vendors before considering upgrades to Platinum.
